    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is the <em>best</em> recipe for a gameday snack - most ingredients are already on hand!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lbs. of <strong>hot</strong> Italian sausage</li>
        <li>2 packages of cream cheese</li>
        <li>2 cans of Rotel</li>
        <li>Tortilla chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, brown the Italian sausage. Try to get it cooked through, there's not much idle time for it to cook later.</li>
        <li>Once the sausage is cooked, add the cream cheese. Break it up with your spatula and mix it until the cream cheese is mostly liquified.</li>
        <li>Drain the water from the Rotel, and add both cans to the pot - stir well.</li>
        <li>Once the dip is thoroughly mixed together, turn the heat to low and serve with tortilla chips.</li>
    </ol>
